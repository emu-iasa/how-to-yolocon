#  How to Yolocon

This doc serves as a skeleton template on how to put on an awesome conference

  ## What is Yolocon?
- YoloCon stand for: Ypsilanti Online Learning Opportunities Conference
- YoloCon is a 100% student led security-focused conference and fundraiser for the Eastern Michigan University Information Assurance Student Association.
 
 ### There are **four** primary goals of this conference:
1. Public Speaking! 📢
	- We get students an opportunity to talk about projects and topics they are passionate about in front of peers, leaders, and industry professionals 

2. Learning! 🎓
	- Security is a wildly broad field. The only limits on topics are: 
		- **NO SALES PITCHES*** (see below) 
		- The subject needs to be related to the cyber security / IT space! 
	
3. Networking! 🌐
	- The security world is a lot smaller than we give it credit for. Meeting people and getting the chance to talk to industry professionals is extremely valuable, especially for entry level students 

4. JOBS! 
	 - Before Yolocon - the IASA collects resumes of **ALL** interested students and puts them in a **resume database**, given to all organizations who decide to help sponsor the club! (Helping get food into the conference IS also sponsoring 😄)

**Vendors and sponsors - Please no sales pitches. Your audience is students and individuals trying to learn about concepts, not products. Talking about the concepts, technology, theories, and issues behind a product you/your org sells is totally fine, but this isn't the place to try and get customers 😄 Thank you!!*

** *Example: Your org sells email spam prevention appliances. Talk about what DMARC security looks like, how you can create logic to detect / prevent spam, why spam + phishing is an issue. Not how awesome your product specifically is :smile:)*

##  What a good conference needs

1. Rooms. Nice Rooms 🏫
	 - Fortunately, EMU has a brand new facility for security! Book rooms well in advance (4-5 months, **AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE**) 
 2. Killer schedule ⏰ 
	 - We have 3 different talks going on at once, each in their own 'Track' 
	 - Scheduling is key. Try to make sure tracks don't overlap too aggressively
	 - Try to have talks in different tracks end at the same time so that everyone has someone listening in on the talk, and some time to catch a break and socialize in-between talks
	
2. Food 🍴
	- Not much to explain here. Nobody hates on a coffee + bagels breakfast and a catered lunch :ok_hand: (We love you Dominos!! 🍕)

3. SWAG :sunglasses: 
	- Free t-shirt / stickers goes a long way. 

4. SUPPORT :muscle:
	- You're not gonna do this alone. Get a group of individuals to help with setup and teardown.
